##remarks
##Thanks for sharing these screenshots — I can read them fine. You’re basically doing exactly the right thing: annotating **what works about Easygenerator** and asking how it could map to *your* WIDA-specific app. Let me reflect what I see and where you could go further:

## 🔹 Strengths You Noted (and How They Help You)
#
# * **No waiting / instant updates** → This is *huge*. Teachers won’t tolerate lag. You can keep your Quick Mode snappy by pre-filling defaults and updating live.
# * **Editable without relying on feedback** → Keep your output in a text box teachers can tweak directly. It reassures them they’re in control.
# * **No AI in theirs → your opportunity** → Where they have only static dropdowns, you can layer in *AI suggestions*: verbs, scaffolds, phrasing refinements.
# * **Dynamic suggestions** (from your annotation: “dynamically changed”) → That’s a great bridge. E.g., if a teacher picks *Explain*, the scaffold list can update automatically to fit.
# * **Elegant finish (copy to clipboard)** → Simple but powerful. Teachers just want to grab the text and paste into lesson plans.
#

#
# ## 🔹 Things to Adapt for WIDA
#
# * **Replace “Condition” with “Supports/Scaffolds.”** That’s where your app becomes *authentic* to WIDA instead of generic corporate.
# * **Domains as multi-select.** Your note about “domain isn’t really just one” is right — teachers often combine Reading + Writing, or Listening + Speaking.
# * **Forms & features attached to functions.** Instead of them being a random extra, you can surface them as AI-suggested phrases once the teacher chooses a function.
# * **Progression bar (Who → Verb → Content → Domain → Supports).** Like theirs, but WIDA-specific. Easy to go forward/back.
#

#
# ## 🔹 What You Can Do Next
#
# * **Go through each page (like you’re doing).** For each, answer:
#
#   * *Do I want this interaction pattern in mine?*
#   * *If so, how do I “translate” it into WIDA language (domain, scaffolds, KLUs)?*
# * **Make a feature adoption list.** E.g.:
#
#   * Keep: live preview, editable output, progress bar, copy button.
#   * Adapt: verb list → WIDA functions, condition → scaffolds.
#   * Drop: Bloom’s taxonomy levels (irrelevant for ESL).
# * **Decide what’s Quick Mode vs. Guided Mode.**
#
#   * Quick Mode → basically their model, but with your WIDA fields.
#   * Guided Mode → your original chat-style detail flow.
#
# ---
#
# ✅ Bottom line: You’re not copying them — you’re **borrowing their clean UX skeleton** and filling it with **WIDA-specific muscles**.

#
# Would you like me to build you a **side-by-side comparison table**: *Easygenerator’s fields vs. Your WIDA fields*, with suggestions on how to rename/reframe each step so it feels distinct?
